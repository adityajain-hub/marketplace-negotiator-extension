# LinkedIn Project Showcase Guide: Marketplace Negotiator Bot

Posting about this project is a great way to demonstrate your skills in **Browser Extensions**, **AI Integration (Gemini)**, and **Web Scraping**.

Here is a strategy to make your post go viral and attract recruiters/peers.

## 1. The Narrative Hook

Don't just say "I built an extension." Tell a story.
**The Story Arc:**

1. **Inspiration**: "I watched Michael Reeves' video about a scam bot..."
2. **The Challenge**: "I wanted to replicate it but use modern tech (Google Gemini 1.5) and make it accessible as a Chrome Extension."
3. **The Hurdles**: "Facebook blocked me. I had to engineer a stealth mode."
4. **The Solution**: "A 'self-healing' extension that sees what you see (Computer Vision) and negotiates for you."

## 2. Visuals (Crucial)

LinkedIn favors video content.

* **Hero Asset**: A 30-60 second screen recording.
  * *Start*: You on a Facebook listing (e.g., that Royal Enfield).
  * *Action*: Open popup -> Select "Aggressive (Reeves Style)" -> "Hindi" -> Click Generate.
  * *Climax*: Show the funny/sarcastic response appearing.
  * *End*: Show the code snippet of the "Stealth Mode" optimization.
* **Carousel**: If you can't do video, do a PDF carousel with:
  * Slide 1: Expectation vs Reality (The Bot).
  * Slide 2: How it works (Architecture Diagram).
  * Slide 3: One of the funniest generated responses.

## 3. Key Technical Skills to Highlight

Tag these in your post to hit keywords:

* `#GoogleGemini` / `#GenerativeAI` (for the brain)
* `#ChromeExtension` (for the platform)
* `#ComputerVision` (for analyzing product photos)
* `#JavaScript` / `#WebScraping` (for the core logic)
* `#StealthEngineering` (creative problem solving)

## 4. Draft Post Template

**Option A: The "Engineer's Journey" (Professional & Tech-focused)**

> 🚀 **I built a Facebook Marketplace Negotiation Bot (inspired by Michael Reeves)**
>
> Last weekend, I saw a video about automating lowball offers and thought: "I can build this, but smarter."
>
> So I engineered the **Marketplace Negotiator**: a Chrome Extension powered by **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
>
> **💡 Under the Hood:**
>
> * **Computer Vision**: It doesn't just read text; it analyzes the product images to find scratches/dents and uses them as leverage.
> * **Multi-Lingual**: Negotiates in English, Hindi, Spanish, or German automatically.
> * **Stealth Mode**: I optimized the scraper's DOM traversal to bypass bot detection checkpoints.
>
> **The Result?**
> A bot that can be polite... or absolutely unhinged (Reeves Style) to get me the best deal on a used bike. 🏍️

**Option B: The "Viral/Fun" Approach**

> **I accidentally built a monster.** 🤖
>
> I wanted a tool to help me buy a used bike on Facebook Marketplace. I ended up building an AI that insults sellers about their photography skills.
>
> Introducing the **Marketplace Negotiator Extension**.
>
> It uses **Google Gemini Vision** to look at your listing, see the rust you tried to hide, and generate a lowball offer so sarcastic that Michael Reeves would be proud.
>
> **Features:**
> ✅ Scrapes live pricing data.
> ✅ Analyzes multiple product images for flaws.
> ✅ "Aggressive Mode" for maximum chaos.
>
> It taught me a lot about Chrome Extensions, API integration, and why we probably shouldn't let AI do *all* our talking. 😂
>
> Watch the demo to see it roast a Royal Enfield listing.

## 5. Deployment

* **GitHub**: Clean up your `README.md`. Make sure it has a screenshot of the popup at the top.
* **Comment**: Post the link to your GitHub repo in the *first comment*, not the main post text (LinkedIn algorithm prefers this).
