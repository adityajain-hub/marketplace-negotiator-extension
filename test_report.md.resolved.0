# Test Report: Facebook Marketplace Scraper

**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Target**: [Royal Enfield classic 350](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1807648289951737/)

## Executive Summary
The scraping logic was verified against a live Facebook Marketplace listing. The initial code required adjustments to properly capture non-standard currency symbols (₹) and variation in description headers. These fixes have been implemented.

## Test Execution Details
| Check | Status | Observed Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title Extraction** | ✅ **PASS** | `Royal Enfield classic 350` | Captured correctly via `h1` fallback. |
| **Price Extraction** | ⚠️ **FIXED** | `₹180,000` | **Issue**: Original regex missed `₹` symbol. **Fix**: Updated regex to `/^[\s₹$£€]*([\d,]+(\.\d{2})?)[\s]*$/`. |
| **Image Extraction** | ✅ **PASS** | `https://scontent...` | Captured high-res image successfully. |
| **Description** | ⚠️ **FIXED** | *Text* | **Issue**: Header was "Seller's description", code looked for "Description". **Fix**: Added loose matching for "details" and "seller's description". |
