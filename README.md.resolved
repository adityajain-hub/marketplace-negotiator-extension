A "self-healing" Chrome Extension that serves as your AI Copilot for negotiating on Facebook Marketplace.

Powered by **Google Gemini Flash**, it uses Computer Vision to analyze product condition and generates negotiation messages ranging from "Polite" to **"Unhinged/Rage-Bait"** (inspired by Michael Reeves).

## 🚀 Features

* **🕵️ Stealth Mode**: Engineered to bypass Facebook's anti-bot detection. The extension does *not* inject scripts automatically. It uses an on-demand "Analyze" button to scrape data only when you ask it to.
* **👁️ Visual Intelligence**: It sees what you see. The AI analyzes the product images to find scratches, dents, or rust, and uses them as leverage in the negotiation.
* **🎭 Dynamic Personas**:
  * **Polite**: Professional and firm.
  * **Confused**: Acts like a boomer who doesn't understand technology.
  * **Aggressive (Reeves Style)**: A chaotic, sarcastic persona that roasts the seller's photography skills and offers 30% of the asking price.
* **🌍 Multi-Lingual**: Automatically detects the listing language and negotiates in English, Hindi, Spanish, French, or German.
* **🧠 Self-Healing**: Automatically detects the best available Gemini model for your API key to prevent "Model Not Found" errors.
