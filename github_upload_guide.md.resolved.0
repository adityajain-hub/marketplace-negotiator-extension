# How to Upload "Marketplace Negotiator" to GitHub

Since you have Git installed, we can do this professionally using the command line.

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
1.  Log in to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
3.  **Repository Name**: `marketplace-negotiator-extension` (or similar).
4.  **Privacy**: Public (so you can share it on LinkedIn).
5.  **Initialize this repository with**: Leave all these **unchecked** (we already have a README and .gitignore).
6.  Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Push Your Code
I will help you run these commands. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in the project folder:
`C:\Users\DELL\.gemini\antigravity\brain\ab269225-0d3e-47aa-9f8a-0f2fc34cde44`

**Run these commands one by one:**

```powershell
# 1. Initialize Git in this folder
git init

# 2. Add all your files
git add .

# 3. Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Marketplace Negotiator V1"

# 4. Link to your new GitHub repo (Replace URL with your actual one!)
# COPY THIS FROM GITHUB PAGE AFTER STEP 1
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marketplace-negotiator-extension.git

# 5. Push the code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Check Your Repo
Refresh your GitHub page. You should see all your files, the beautiful README, and the project ready to share!
